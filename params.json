To win War, you must answer 2 of your opponent's 3 cards\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nGame ends when one of you is out of cards.\r\n\r\n## Implementation concepts\r\n* Keep track of # of right and wrong answers for each flash-card.\r\n\r\n* consider using ratio of right/wrong + #times seen to scale how often a flash-card is seen.\r\n\r\n* You might make a pool of questions > 52 and select the question for each card out of the pool as it is 'flipped'. Decouple the flash-card from the game card. the game cards are just a token to track game progress.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'warcards'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install warcards\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAs of today, if you run bin/warcards it will play a game of war with you and quiz you as you play.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
